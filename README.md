# 🎧 Hearing Loss & Hearing Aid Simulator – DE1-SoC Project

##  Purpose

This project simulates the experience of **hearing loss** and the effect of **hearing aids** using real-time audio processing, VGA visuals, and PS/2 keyboard inputs on the **DE1-SoC board**.

We created this to help raise awareness, foster empathy, and demonstrate the value of assistive technologies in hearing health. Through volume reduction, background noise distortion, and echo processing, users can "hear" what it might feel like to struggle with audio perception—and see how hearing aids might help.

##  What This Project Does

###  System Overview

- **Input**: Microphone or preloaded audio samples
- **Processing**:
  - Hearing Loss: Volume reduction, noise distortion, speech degradation
  - Hearing Aid: Volume gain, noise suppression, optional echo
  - Toggle echo, distortion, and low-pass filters
- **Output**: Processed stereo audio + VGA screen visuals
- **User Control**: PS/2 keyboard & DE1 keys for switching modes and levels
